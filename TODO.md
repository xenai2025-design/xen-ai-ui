# Secure Configuration Management Implementation

## Part 1: Secure AI Model Configuration Storage

### Database & Backend Changes
- [x] Create encryption middleware for sensitive data
- [x] Update database.js to include ai_model_configs table
- [x] Create configuration service for managing AI model configs
- [x] Create secure config API routes with authentication
- [x] Update chat.js to use dynamic configuration instead of hardcoded values
- [x] Add config routes to server.js

### Frontend Changes
- [x] Update api.js to include AI model config endpoints
- [ ] Test configuration loading in ChatBot component

## Part 2: Environment Variables & Security
- [x] Move sensitive data to environment variables
- [x] Test the complete secure configuration flow
- [x] Verify encryption/decryption works properly

## Testing & Validation
- [x] Test basic server functionality with new configuration system
- [x] Verify encryption middleware works correctly
- [ ] Test chat functionality with dynamic AI model configuration
- [ ] Verify authentication is required for config access
- [ ] Test configuration updates and refresh
