# Debug HTTPS Issue - Still Using HTTPS Despite HTTP Configuration

## üîç Problem
Your app is still trying to use HTTPS even though all configuration files are set to HTTP.

## üïµÔ∏è Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check AWS Amplify Environment Variables

**This is the most likely cause!**

1. Go to **AWS Amplify Console**
2. Select your app
3. Go to **"App settings" ‚Üí "Environment variables"**
4. Look for `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
5. If it's set to HTTPS, **change it to HTTP**:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://xen-ai-test-env.eba-yqhbvx3c.ap-northeast-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/api
   ```
6. **Redeploy** your app

### Step 2: Check Browser Console

1. Open your deployed app
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Look for debug messages starting with "üîç Environment Variables:"
5. Check what `API_BASE_URL` is actually set to

### Step 3: Clear All Caches

1. **Browser Cache:**
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Chrome/Firefox)
   - Or open in incognito/private mode

2. **Amplify Build Cache:**
   - In Amplify Console, go to your app
   - Click "Redeploy this version" 
   - Or trigger a new build

### Step 4: Verify Local Build

Test locally to make sure the configuration is correct:

```bash
# Build locally
npm run build

# Serve the built files
npx serve dist

# Open http://localhost:3000 and check console logs
```

### Step 5: Check All Environment Files

Verify these files all use HTTP:

- ‚úÖ `.env.local` - `http://...`
- ‚úÖ `.env.production` - `http://...`
- ‚úÖ `.env.example` - `http://...`
- ‚úÖ `src/context/AuthContext.jsx` - Default fallback is `http://...`

## üéØ Most Likely Solutions

### Solution 1: AWS Amplify Environment Variable (90% chance)
The environment variable in AWS Amplify is still set to HTTPS. Update it and redeploy.

### Solution 2: Browser Cache (5% chance)
Clear browser cache or test in incognito mode.

### Solution 3: Build Cache (5% chance)
Trigger a fresh build in AWS Amplify.

## üîß Quick Fix Commands

```bash
# 1. Commit current changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix HTTP configuration and add debug logging"
git push origin main

# 2. Check what's actually being built
npm run build
grep -r "https://" dist/ || echo "No HTTPS found in build"

# 3. Test locally
npx serve dist
# Open http://localhost:3000 and check console
```

## üìã Checklist

- [ ] AWS Amplify environment variable updated to HTTP
- [ ] App redeployed in Amplify
- [ ] Browser cache cleared
- [ ] Console logs checked for actual API_BASE_URL value
- [ ] Tested in incognito/private mode
- [ ] Local build tested

## üö® If Still Not Working

1. **Delete the environment variable entirely** in AWS Amplify
2. Let it use the fallback URL from the code
3. Redeploy

## üìû Debug Information to Collect

When you open your deployed app, collect this info from browser console:

1. The debug log showing environment variables
2. Any network requests in the Network tab
3. The exact error message
4. The URL being used in failed requests

This will help identify exactly where the HTTPS URL is coming from.
